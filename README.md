# Solutions for Advent of Code 2015 in Kotlin

Welcome!  In this repository, you can find solutions for all Advent of Code[^aoc] puzzles of 2015 written in
[Kotlin][kotlin] programming language.

Feel free to explore the repository and browse the solutions (the `src/main/kotlin/` directory), or to attempt to launch
them one by one.  It is perhaps the easiest to launch them from the IDE, so you'll have to import the project into the
IDE of your choosing, and open it there.  Note that the repository does not contain the actual puzzle input (`input.txt`
file for each of the daily puzzles) in accordance with the [plea of the Advent of Code maker][aoc_copying].  If you
decide to launch any of the solutions, you'll have to provide your own personal inputs obtained from the main site.


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.  Every
    year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five
    days.  Everyone can solve the puzzles and provide answers using the language of their choice.  This repository uses
    the **Kotlin** language to provide solutions.
