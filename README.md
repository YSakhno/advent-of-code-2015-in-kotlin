Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [ysakhno][github].

In this repository, I am about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

If you're stuck with Kotlin-specific questions or anything related to this template, check out the following resources:


[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.  Every
    year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five
    days.  Everyone can solve the puzzles and provide answers using the language of their choice.
